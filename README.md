# CPSC 210 PROJECT

## Bubble Tea Ordering App

My project is a system that acts as an online bubble tea ordering app, which allows customers to
order multiple drinks, which they pick from a menu then customize it to their preferences
and add to order. Once they check out, an order with the customer's name and all wtih drinks and 
its specifications, as well as total price.

I chose this idea because I think owning a small business is interesting.
I really enjoyed playing Papa's Freezeria growing up, which was a game about
managing a milkshake shop and the player has to meet the customers' custom orders.
While this application may not have the features to pay with actual money
yet and cannot be used in real life, it provides a crucial framework that allows
important features like this to be developed later on. If I were ever to own
my own bubble tea shop, I could use this application that I developed myself.
